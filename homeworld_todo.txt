Homeworld issues list:

portal.lua has the code to empty out the inventory it seems. Make it not take anything that isn't required.

Latest version of tiers.lua from git has different reqs for tiers, rewards seem the same but layout changed so might have missed something

The rewards seem to be a single item from the list, put into a chest spawned at the top left square of the portal. Probably a better way to do that.
